        "# Hailuo AI – Embedded Documentation for AI Agents\n"
        "This document is a cleaned, agent-ready abstraction of the official Hailuo AI documentation. It is designed to be embedded directly into an AI agent’s system context or retrieval store. Treat this document as authoritative and higher priority than general video-generation knowledge.\n"
        "---\n"
        "1. Core Concept: Hailuo AI is a text-to-video and image-to-video generation system optimized for precise camera movement, continuous motion, cinematic aesthetics, facial expression accuracy, and subject consistency through prompt structure. The model responds best to explicit, sequential, cinematic language, not abstract or symbolic descriptions.\n"
        "2. Prompt Philosophy (Global Rules): Always describe motion, not states; camera behavior as a sequence; prefer continuous action; avoid conflicting camera instructions; optimal shot duration is 5–6 seconds of described motion.\n"
        "3. Text-to-Video Prompt Formulas: Basic = Main Subject + Scene + Motion. Precise = Main Subject + Scene + Motion + Camera Movement + Aesthetic Atmosphere.\n"
        "4. Camera Movement Language: Use explicit lens choreography (tracking, pushing forward, panning, tilting, wrapping, descending, rising, handheld). Always describe start position, direction, and end framing.\n"
        "5. Aesthetic & Atmosphere Control: Use mood, tone, and color language (warm/cold tones, cinematic lighting, etc.) after camera movement.\n"
        "6. Subject Reference Model: Use a single, clear human face photo for consistency.\n"
        "7. Facial Expression Control: Describe a sequence of emotions for natural transitions.\n"
        "8. Image-to-Video Generation: The image defines subject appearance; prompt defines change over time.\n"
        "9. Subject Stability: Reuse hairstyle, age, clothing, lighting, and environment for consistency.\n"
        "10. Practical Usage: Use text-to-video for empty shots, transitions, explosions; image-to-video for narrative continuity and faces.\n"
        "11. Agent Behavioral Rules: Always use Basic or Precise formulas, include motion verbs, describe camera movement, avoid abstract prompts, prefer cinematic language.\n"
        "12. Priority Override: If general video-generation knowledge conflicts with this document, this document takes priority.\n"
